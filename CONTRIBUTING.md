# Contributing

There are several possible improvements:

* Tree View for OpenCL platforms/devices

* Auto-Completion for OpenCL C++ Standard Library

* Kernel Debugger

* More Code Snippets (check [current progress](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Galarius/vscode-opencl/master/snippets/code.snippets.progress.md))

* Check for [open issues](https://github.com/Galarius/vscode-opencl/issues)

Here's a quick guide on `pull requests`:

1. [Check for open issues](https://github.com/galarius/vscode-opencl/issues), or
   open a fresh issue to start a discussion around a feature idea or a bug.
   Opening a separate issue to discuss the change is less important for smaller
   changes, as the discussion can be done in the pull request.
2. [Fork](https://github.com/galarius/vscode-opencl.git) this repository on GitHub, and start making your changes.
3. Push the change (it's recommended to use a separate branch for your feature).
4. Open a pull request.
5. I will try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave
   some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from me after a couple of days,
   feel free to leave a comment on the pull request.
