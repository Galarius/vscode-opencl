### Offline OpenCL Kernel Compilation

The extension provides predefined set of VS Code tasks for kernel compilation using `ioc32/ioc64` or `openclc` (on macOS).

### Run Predefined Task

1. Press `Tasks > Run Task...`

2. Press `Run Task...` and select one of the predefined `opencl` tasks for file `kernel.cl`. The set of tasks (fig. 1) is generated for each kernel file that was found in the current workspace.

    *Figure 1. Predefined Tasks for `ioc64` compiler.*

### Customize Build Task

Press `Tasks > Configure Tasks...`. Select one of the predefined `opencl` tasks. File `tasks.json` will be created (or extended) with configuration of the selected task.

You can override `command` and `args` fields to use another compiler. Field `label` is a displayed task name, `problemMatcher` should be overriten to match a compiler's errors and warnings so messages could be displayed in `Problems` view.

An example of modified `tasks.json` configuration file for using [AMD Mali](https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/graphics-development-tools/mali-offline-compiler) as OpenCL offline compiler:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "shell",
            "label": "opencl: malisc compile",
            "task": "compile",
            "command": "malisc",
            "args": [
                "--name kernelName",
                "kernel.cl"
            ],
            "problemMatcher": [
                {
                    "owner": "opencl",
                    "fileLocation": ["relative", "${workspaceFolder}"],
                    "pattern": {
                        "regexp": "^(ERROR|WARNING): <(.*)>:(\\d+):(\\d+): (error|warning): (.*)$",
                        "file": 2,
                        "line": 3,
                        "column": 4,
                        "severity": 1,
                        "message": 6
                    }
                }
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
