Parameters
----------

`device`  
A device returned by [`clGetDeviceIDs`](clGetDeviceIDs.html).

May be a device returned by [`clGetDeviceIDs`](clGetDeviceIDs.html) or a
sub-device created by [`clCreateSubDevices`](clCreateSubDevices.html).
If `device` is a sub-device, the specific information for the sub-device
will be returned. The information that can be queried using
`clGetDeviceInfo` is specified in the table below (Table 4.3).

`param_value`  
A pointer to memory location where appropriate values for a given
`param_name` as specified in the table below will be returned. If
`param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`  
Specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`. This
size in bytes must be ≥ size of return type specified in the table
below.

`param_value_size_ret`  
Returns the actual size in bytes of data being queried by `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_name`  
An enumeration constant that identifies the device information being
queried. It can be one of the values as specified in the table below.

Double precision is     an optional feature     so the mandated         minimum double          precision               floating-point          capability is 0.        If double precision     is supported by the     device, then the        minimum double          precision               floating-point          capability must be:     `CL_FP_FMA`   `CL_FP_ROUND_TO_NEARE   ST`                     `CL_FP_DENORM`.       |

This is a       bit-field that          describes one or more   of the following        values:                 `CL_EXEC_KERNEL` -      The OpenCL device can   execute OpenCL          kernels.                `CL_EXEC_NATIVE_KERNE   L` -                    The OpenCL device can   execute native          kernels.

Notes
-----

`CL_DEVICE_PROFILE`: The platform profile returns the profile that is
implemented by the OpenCL framework. If the platform profile returned is
`FULL_PROFILE`, the OpenCL framework will support devices that are
`FULL_PROFILE` and may also support devices that are `EMBEDDED_PROFILE`.
The compiler must be available for all devices i.e.
`CL_DEVICE_COMPILER_AVAILABLE` is `CL_TRUE`. If the platform profile
returned is `EMBEDDED_PROFILE`, then devices that are only
`EMBEDDED_PROFILE` are supported.

The device queries described in the table above should return the same
information for a root-level device i.e. a device returned by
[`clGetDeviceIDs`](clGetDeviceIDs.html) and any sub-devices created from
this device except for the following queries:

-   `CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_MEM_CACHE_SIZE`

-   `CL_DEVICE_BUILT_IN_KERNELS`

-   `CL_DEVICE_PARENT_DEVICE`

-   `CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_TYPE`

-   `CL_DEVICE_REFERENCE_COUNT`

Errors
------

`clGetDeviceInfo` returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed
successfully. Otherwise, it returns the following:

-   `CL_INVALID_DEVICE` if `device` is not valid.

-   `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not one of the supported
    values or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is less
    than size of return type as shown in the table above and
    `param_value` is not a `NULL` value or if `param_name` is a value
    that is available as an extension and the corresponding extension is
    not supported by the device.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
