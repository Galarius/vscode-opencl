## Parameters

`device`  
A device returned by [`clGetDeviceIDs`](clGetDeviceIDs.html).

May be a device returned by [`clGetDeviceIDs`](clGetDeviceIDs.html) or a
sub-device created by [`clCreateSubDevices`](clCreateSubDevices.html).
If `device` is a sub-device, the specific information for the sub-device
will be returned. The information that can be queried using
`clGetDeviceInfo` is specified in the table below (Table 4.3).

`param_value`  
A pointer to memory location where appropriate values for a given
`param_name` as specified in the table below will be returned. If
`param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`  
Specifies the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`. This
size in bytes must be ≥ size of return type specified in the table
below.

`param_value_size_ret`  
Returns the actual size in bytes of data being queried by `param_value`.
If `param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_name`  
An enumeration constant that identifies the device information being
queried. It can be one of the values as specified in the table below.

## Notes

`CL_DEVICE_PROFILE`: The platform profile returns the profile that is
implemented by the OpenCL framework. If the platform profile returned is
`FULL_PROFILE`, the OpenCL framework will support devices that are
`FULL_PROFILE` and may also support devices that are `EMBEDDED_PROFILE`.
The compiler must be available for all devices i.e.
`CL_DEVICE_COMPILER_AVAILABLE` is `CL_TRUE`. If the platform profile
returned is `EMBEDDED_PROFILE`, then devices that are only
`EMBEDDED_PROFILE` are supported.

The device queries described in the table above should return the same
information for a root-level device i.e. a device returned by
[`clGetDeviceIDs`](clGetDeviceIDs.html) and any sub-devices created from
this device except for the following queries:

-   `CL_DEVICE_GLOBAL_MEM_CACHE_SIZE`

-   `CL_DEVICE_BUILT_IN_KERNELS`

-   `CL_DEVICE_PARENT_DEVICE`

-   `CL_DEVICE_PARTITION_TYPE`

-   `CL_DEVICE_REFERENCE_COUNT`

## Errors

`clGetDeviceInfo` returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed
successfully. Otherwise, it returns the following:

-   `CL_INVALID_DEVICE` if `device` is not valid.

-   `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not one of the supported
    values or if size in bytes specified by `param_value_size` is less
    than size of return type as shown in the table above and
    `param_value` is not a `NULL` value or if `param_name` is a value
    that is available as an extension and the corresponding extension is
    not supported by the device.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
