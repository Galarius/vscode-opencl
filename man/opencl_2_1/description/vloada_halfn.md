## Description

For n = 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 read sizeof(`halfn`) bytes of data from
address (`p` + (`offset` \* `n`)). The data read is interpreted as a
`halfn` value. The `halfn` value read is converted to a `floatn` value
and the `floatn` value is returned.

The address computed as (`p` + (`offset` \* `n`)) must be aligned to
sizeof(`halfn`) bytes.

For n = 3, `vloada_half3` reads a `half3` from address (`p` + (`offset`
\* 4)) and returns a `float3`. The address computed as (`p` + (`offset`
\* 4)) must be aligned to sizeof (`half`) \* 4 bytes.

## Notes

Vector Data Load and Store Functions allow you to read and write vector
types from a pointer to memory.

The suffix `n` in the function names (i.e. vload\`n\`, vstore\`n\` etc.)
represent `n`-element vectors, where `n` = 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16.

The results of vector data load and store functions are undefined if the
address being read from or written to is not correctly aligned. The
pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to [`global`](global.html),
[`local`](local.html), or [`private`](private.html) memory for store
functions. The pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to global, local,
constant or private memory for load functions.

In addition `vloada_half3` reads `x`, `y`, `z` components from address
(`p` + (`offset` \* 4)) into a 3- component vector.
