## Notes

Decrements the `device` reference count if device is a valid sub-device
created by a call to [`clCreateSubDevices`](clCreateSubDevices.html). If
`device` is a root level device i.e. a `cl_device_id` returned by
[`clGetDeviceIDs`](clGetDeviceIDs.html), the `device` reference count
remains unchanged.

After the `device` reference count becomes zero and all the objects
attached to `device` (such as command-queues) are released, the `device`
object is deleted. Using this function to release a reference that was
not obtained by creating the object or by calling
[`clRetainDevice`](clRetainDevice.html) causes undefined behavior.

## Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

-   `CL_INVALID_DEVICE` if `device` is not a valid sub-device created by
    a call to [`clCreateSubDevices`](clCreateSubDevices.html).

-   `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
