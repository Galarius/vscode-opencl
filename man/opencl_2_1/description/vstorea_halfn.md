## Description

The `floatn` (or `doublen`) value given by `data` is converted to a
`halfn` value using the appropriate rounding mode.

For n = 2, 4, 8 and 16, the `halfn` value is written to the address
computed as (`p` + (`offset` \* `n`)). The address computed as (`p` +
(`offset` \* `n`)) must be aligned to sizeof (halfn) bytes.

For n = 3, the `half3` value is written to the address computed as (`p`
+ (`offset` \* 4)). The address computed as (`p` + (`offset` \* 4)) must
be aligned to sizeof (half) \* 4 bytes.

`vstorea_halfn` uses the default rounding mode. The default rounding
mode is round to the nearest even.

An application that wants to use `half` and `halfn` types will need to
include the `#pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp16 : enable` directive.

## Notes

Vector Data Load and Store Functions allow you to read and write vector
types from a pointer to memory.

The suffix `n` in the function names (i.e. vload\`n\`, vstore\`n\` etc.)
represent `n`-element vectors, where `n` = 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16.

The results of vector data load and store functions are undefined if the
address being read from or written to is not correctly aligned. The
pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to [`global`](global.html),
[`local`](local.html), or [`private`](private.html) memory for store
functions. The pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to global, local,
constant or private memory for load functions.

`vstorea_half3` writes `x`, `y`, `z` components from a 3-component
vector to address (`p` + (`offset` \* 4)).
