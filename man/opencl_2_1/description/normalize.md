## Description

Returns a vector in the same direction as `p` but with a length of 1.

## Notes

General information about built-in geometric functions: Built-in
geometric functions operate component-wise. The description is
per-component. `floatn` is `float`, `float2`, `float3`, or `float4` and
`doublen` is `double`, `double2`, `double3`, or `double4`. The built-in
geometric functions are implemented using the round to nearest even
rounding mode.

The geometric functions can be implemented using contractions such as
[`mad`](mad.html) or [`fma`](fma.html).

If extended with [`cl_khr_fp16`](cl_khr_fp16.html), generic type name
`gentype` may indicate `half` and `half{2|3|4}` as arguments and return
values.
