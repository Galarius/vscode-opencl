## Description

Read sizeof(`halfn`) bytes of data from address (`p` + (`offset` \*
`n`)). The data read is interpreted as a `halfn` value.

The `halfn` value read is converted to a `floatn` value and the `floatn`
value is returned. The read address computed as (`p` + (`offset` \*
`n`)) must be 16-bit aligned.

## Notes

Vector Data Load and Store Functions allow you to read and write vector
types from a pointer to memory.

The suffix `n` in the function names (i.e. vload\`n\`, vstore\`n\` etc.)
represent `n`-element vectors, where `n` = 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16.

The results of vector data load and store functions are undefined if the
address being read from or written to is not correctly aligned. The
pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to [`global`](global.html),
[`local`](local.html), or [`private`](private.html) memory for store
functions. The pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to global, local,
constant or private memory for load functions.

We use the type name `halfn` to represent n-element vectors of `half`
elements.

When extended by the [`cl_khr_fp16`](cl_khr_fp16.html) extension, the
generic type `gentypen` is extended to include `half`, `half2`, `half3`,
`half4`, `half8`, and `half16`.

`vload3` and `vload_half3` read `x`, `y`, `z` components from address
(`p` + (`offset` \* 3)) into a 3-component vector.
