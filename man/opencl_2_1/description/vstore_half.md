## Description

The `float` (or `double`) value given by `data` is first converted to a
half value using the appropriate rounding mode. The half value is then
written to address computed as (`p` + `offset`). The address computed as
(`p` + `offset`) must be 16-bit aligned.

`vstore_half` uses the current rounding mode. The default current
rounding mode is round to nearest even.

## Notes

Vector Data Load and Store Functions allow you to read and write vector
types from a pointer to memory.

The suffix `n` in the function names (i.e. vload\`n\`, vstore\`n\` etc.)
represent `n`-element vectors, where `n` = 2, 3, 4, 8 or 16.

The results of vector data load and store functions are undefined if the
address being read from or written to is not correctly aligned. The
pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to [`global`](global.html),
[`local`](local.html), or [`private`](private.html) memory for store
functions. The pointer argument `p` can be a pointer to global, local,
constant or private memory for load functions.
