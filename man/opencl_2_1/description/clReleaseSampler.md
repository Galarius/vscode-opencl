## Parameters

`sampler`  
Specifies the `sampler` being retained.

## Notes

The sampler object is deleted after the reference count becomes zero and
commands queued for execution on a command-queue(s) that use `sampler`
have finished.

Using this function to release a reference that was not obtained by
creating the object or by calling
[`clRetainSampler`](clRetainSampler.html) causes undefined behavior.

## Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

-   `CL_INVALID_SAMPLER` if `sampler` is not a valid sampler object.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
