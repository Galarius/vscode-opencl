## Description

The built-in function `signbit` tests for sign bit. For the forms not
dependent on the [`cl_khr_fp16`](cl_khr_fp16.html) extension, the scalar
version of the function returns a 1 if the sign bit in the float is set
else returns 0. The vector version of the function returns the following
for each component in float\`n\`: -1 (i.e. all bits set) if the sign bit
in the float is set else returns 0.

For the forms enabled by the [`cl_khr_fp16`](cl_khr_fp16.html)
extension, the function returns a 1 if the sign bit in the half is set
else returns 0. The vector version of the function returns the following
for each component in half\`n\`: -1 (i.e. all bits set) if the sign bit
in the half is set else returns 0.

## Notes

If an implementation extends this specification to support IEEE-754
flags or exceptions, then all built-in relational functions shall
proceed without raising the `invalid` floating-point exception when one
or more of the operands are NaNs.

The built-in relational functions are extended with
[`cl_khr_fp16`](cl_khr_fp16.html) to include versions that take `half`,
and `half{2|3|4|8|16}` as arguments.

The function returns a 0 if the specified relation is `false` and a 1 if
the specified relation is `true` for scalar argument types. These
functions shall return a 0 if the specified relation is `false` and a -
1 (i.e. all bits set) if the specified relation is `true` for vector
argument types.
