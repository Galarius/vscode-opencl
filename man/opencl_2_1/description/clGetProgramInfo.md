## Parameters

`program`  
Specifies the program object being queried.

`param_name`  
Specifies the information to query. The list of supported `param_name`
types and the information returned in `param_value` by
`clGetProgramInfo` is described in the table below.

| cl\_program\_info                 | Return Type and Info. returned in |
| --- | --- |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_REFERENCE_COUNT`      |  `param_value`                       Return type: cl\_uint               Return the `program` reference      count.                              The reference count returned        should be considered immediately    stale. It is unsuitable for         general use in applications. This   feature is provided for           |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_CONTEXT`              |  identifying memory leaks.           Return type: cl\_context            Return the context specified when |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_NUM_DEVICES`          |  the program object is created       Return type: cl\_uint               Return the number of devices      |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_DEVICES`              |  associated with `program`.          Return type: cl\_device\_id\[\]     Return the list of devices          associated with the program         object. This can be the devices     associated with context on which    the program object has been         created or can be a subset of       devices that are specified when a   progam object is created using      [`clCreateProgramWithBinary`]     |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_SOURCE`               |  (clCreateProgramWithBinary.html).   Return type: char\[\]               Return the program source code      specified by                        [`clCreateProgramWithSource`]       (clCreateProgramWithSource.html).   The source string returned is a     concatenation of all source         strings specified to                [`clCreateProgramWithSource`        ](clCreateProgramWithSource.html)   with a null terminator. The         concatenation strips any nulls in   the original source strings.        If `program` is created using       [`clCreateProgramWithBinary`]       (clCreateProgramWithBinary.html),   [`clCreateProgramWith               IL`](clCreateProgramWithIL.html),   or                                  [`clCreatePr                        ogramWithBuiltInKernels`](clCreat   eProgramWithBuiltInKernels.html),   a null string or the appropriate    program source code is returned     depending on whether or not the     program source code is stored in    the binary.                         The actual number of characters     that represents the program         source code including the null      terminator is returned in         |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_IL`                   |  `param_value_size_ret`.             Return type: void \*                Returns the program IL for          programs created with               [`clCreateProgramWith               IL`](clCreateProgramWithIL.html).   If `program` is created with        [`clCreateProgramWithSource`]       (clCreateProgramWithSource.html),   [`clCreateProgramWithBinary`        ](clCreateProgramWithBinary.html)   or                                  [`clCreateP                         rogramWithBuiltInKernels`](clCrea   teProgramWithBuiltInKernels.html)   the memory pointed to by            `param_value` will be unchanged     and `param_value_size_ret` will   |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_BINARY_SIZES`         |  be set to 0.                        Return type: size\_t\[\]            Returns an array that contains      the size in bytes of the program    binary (could be an executable      binary, compiled binary or          library binary) for each device     associated with `program`. The      size of the array is the number     of devices associated with          `program`. If a binary is not       available for a device(s), a size   of zero is returned.                If `program` is created using       [`clCreatePr                        ogramWithBuiltInKernels`](clCreat   eProgramWithBuiltInKernels.html),   the implementation may return       zero in any entries of the        |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES`             |  returned array.                     Return type: unsigned char \*\[\]   Return the program binaries         (could be an executable binary,     compiled binary or library          binary) for all devices             associated with `program`. For      each device in `program`, the       binary returned can be the binary   specified for the device when       `program` is created with           [`clCreateProgramWithBinary`        ](clCreateProgramWithBinary.html)   or it can be the executable         binary generated by                 [`clBu                              ildProgram`](clBuildProgram.html)   or                                  [`clL                               inkProgram`](clLinkProgram.html).   If `program` is created with        [`clCreateProgramWithSource`        ](clCreateProgramWithSource.html)   or                                  [`clCreateProgramWith               IL`](clCreateProgramWithIL.html),   the binary returned is the binary   generated by                        [`clBui                             ldProgram`](clBuildProgram.html),   [`clCompile                         Program`](clCompileProgram.html),   or                                  [`clL                               inkProgram`](clLinkProgram.html).   The bits returned can be an         implementation-specific             intermediate representation         (a.k.a. IR) or device specific      executable bits or both. The        decision on which information is    returned in the binary is up to     the OpenCL implementation.          `param_value` points to an array    of `n` pointers allocated by the    caller, where `n` is the number     of devices associated with          program. The buffer sizes needed    to allocate the memory that these   `n` pointers refer to can be        queried using the                   `CL_PROGRAM_BINARY_SIZES` query     as described in this table.         Each entry in this array is used    by the implementation as the        location in memory where to copy    the program binary for a specific   device, if there is a binary        available. To find out which        device the program binary in the    array refers to, use the            `CL_PROGRAM_DEVICES` query to get   the list of devices. There is a     one-to-one correspondence between   the array of `n` pointers           returned by `CL_PROGRAM_BINARIES`   and array of devices returned by    `CL_PROGRAM_DEVICES.`               If an entry value in the array is   NULL, the implementation skips      copying the program binary for      the specific device identified by |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_NUM_KERNELS`          |  the array index.                    Return type: size\_t                Returns the number of kernels       declared in `program` that can be   created with                        [`clCre                             ateKernel`](clCreateKernel.html).   This information is only            available after a successful        program executable has been built   for at least one device in the      list of devices associated with   |
|  `CL_PROGRAM_KERNEL_NAMES`         |  `program`.                          Return type: char\[\]               Returns a semi-colon separated      list of kernel names in `program`   that can be created with            [`clCre                             ateKernel`](clCreateKernel.html).   This information is only            available after a successful        program executable has been built   for at least one device in the      list of devices associated with   |

`param_value`  
A pointer to memory where the appropriate result being queried is
returned. If `param_value` is NULL, it is ignored.

`param_value_size`  
Used to specify the size in bytes of memory pointed to by `param_value`.
This size must be ≥ size of return type as described in the table above.

`param_value_size_ret`  
Returns the actual size in bytes of data copied to `param_value`. If
`param_value_size_ret` is NULL, it is ignored.

## Errors

Returns `CL_SUCCESS` if the function is executed successfully.
Otherwise, it returns one of the following errors:

-   `CL_INVALID_VALUE` if `param_name` is not valid, or if size in bytes
    specified by `param_value_size` is &lt; size of return type as
    described in the table above and `param_value` is not NULL.

-   `CL_INVALID_PROGRAM` if `program` is not a valid program object.

-   `CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE` if `param_name` is
    `CL_PROGRAM_NUM_KERNELS` or `CL_PROGRAM_KERNEL_NAMES` and a
    successful program executable has not been built for at least one
    device in the list of devices associated with `program`.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the device.

-   `CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY` if there is a failure to allocate resources
    required by the OpenCL implementation on the host.
